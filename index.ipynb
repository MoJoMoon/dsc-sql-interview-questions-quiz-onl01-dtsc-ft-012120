    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",

    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "There are several types of JOINs in SQL, ranging from Inner and Outer, to Left and Right JOINS. These JOINs describe the where the columns align in the new dataframe.\n",

    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "Aggrefate functions and Group by statements have a close relationship. Aggregate functions allow us to gleen statistical information on various columns, while Group by statementshelp us to organize the dataframe based on a particular column.\n",
